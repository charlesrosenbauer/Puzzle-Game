# Puzzle-Game
A Simple Puzzle game written in C++ and SDL1.2.

This was a project that didn't pan out how I wanted it to. Regardless, I think it turned out pretty well for what it is.

I may take this somewhere yet, but I'm not confident on that. I'm not convinced that the puzzle mechanics are that good. It seems really easy for players to simply brute-force their way through it.

The level editor, if you wish to use it, has to be accessed by modifying code. It's commented out in src/core/main.cpp, but that can be pretty easily changed. Commenting out some code above it will disable the main game and bring you directly to editor upon startup. It's not the best editor, but it sufficed for me when I was working on it.
